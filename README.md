# Text-Encryption-in-Image

Project Topic:Hiding text in image(Text to image encryption)

Summary :

The project introduces a program which can hide any text / numbers into a given image. This technique can be used for passing on secret messages among different agencies.

Here a given image is taken and a desired text converted to ascii Code is stored in that image array and accordingly the gray values of image changes , since the array of image is very large in comparison to the array of ascii codes of the text.



Problems that project solves:

Majorly the agencies sending secret messages does by morse code , but it has become too common and any one after learning the codes for alphabets and symbols can decode it, hence it is no more secretive, nut imagine same message is being send to the decoders in form of basic image files than the chances of someone recognizing lessens, also if someone is aware about such thing , he wonâ€™t be able to decode it in ages since our methods uses a human made function we cannot be configured in ages. So relax!!

This kind of problem motivated us to move forward.


List of problems solved by the project:

Problem solved by us is security and encrypting secret messages and it's a very safe method for secret communication.

Provide a detailed explanation of how this project solves the problem(s).
